# Changelog

Brief log of notable changes, grouped by theme — not a full commit history
(see `git log` for that). New entries get appended under the section they
fit best; add a new section if none fits.

## Auth
- Logged-in/out header state via silent token refresh, redirect to
  schlussel's hosted login and back.
- The home page now requires authentication - unauthenticated visitors
  redirect straight to schlussel's login instead of seeing any content.
- Adopted Authorization Code + PKCE for the login handoff: generates and
  stores a PKCE verifier before redirecting, and the callback page
  exchanges the returned code for the real token via POST /auth/token
  instead of reading it from the URL fragment.
- Restore the stored theme before first paint (a synchronous inline
  script in index.html's `<head>`, matching schlussel/web and kuvert)
  instead of only after HomePage's first render, and render a themed
  blank div in AuthCallbackPage instead of nothing - reduces the flash
  during the SSO silent-reauth redirect chain, which can load and unload
  this page within a fraction of a second.

## Infrastructure
- CI (tests + lint) on every push/PR.
- Docker Compose networking on a shared `schloss-net`.
- Migrated from nginx to Caddy in the web image.
- Docker images published to GHCR on merge to `main`.
- Dependabot for both npm and GitHub Actions dependencies.
- Dropped published host port - reached only through the tor gateway now.
- Fixed docker-compose.yml's default `VITE_KUVERT_URL`/`VITE_SCHLUSSEL_URL`
  to `https://` - tor's gateway auto-upgrades everything to HTTPS, so the
  old `http://` defaults sent visitors to the wrong redirect target.
- Fixed a stale `http://` mention of the gateway URL in README.md.
- Pinned `pnpm/action-setup`'s version exactly in CI - letting it
  self-update to the latest 11.x broke every workflow run once pnpm
  11.12.0 shipped with a bug in its own self-installer, unrelated to
  any change in this repo.

## Docs
- README, AGPL-3.0 LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Improved the browser tab title.
- Added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, issue templates, and a pull
  request template.

## Polish
- Homepage visual polish: hero illustration, a three-tile highlights strip,
  a GitHub link in the footer, smoother card hover easing.
- Extracted Header/Footer out of HomePage.tsx into their own components
  (`src/components/Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`) - same visuals, now the
  reference structure the other two services' header/footer work copies.
  Also stopped caching `/favicon.svg` as `immutable` for a year - the
  Caddyfile's cache rule now only matches Vite's hashed `/assets/*`
  output, not root-level static files that never change filename.
- Replaced the homepage hero illustration - an 8-bit indexed-color raster
  PNG that looked washed out/banded at display size - with a crisp inline
  SVG castle (`src/components/HeroIllustration.tsx`), in the existing
  brand palette. Also redrew `favicon.svg`: the old mark was an abstract
  gradient-blob silhouette that read as a generic lightning bolt at a
  glance; replaced with a padlock matching the header logo's shape.
- License/CI badges, a link to the Hof meta-repo, fixed gateway repo URL
  casing after its rename to lowercase.
- Wrote the gateway's project name lowercase ("tor") everywhere in prose.
